class="description-container"><div><h3 class="desc-title">Trash</h3><p class="desc-text">The amount of waste we produce is increasing every year, which leads to environmental pollution and exacerbates problems like global warming.
Waste disposal requires a significant amount of energy and can result in groundwater contamination.
It&#x27;s crucial to reduce the amount of waste we produce to address these issues. We can do this by reducing our use of disposable items and actively practicing recycling and reusing.
Protecting the environment is essential for maintaining human health.
  
We can all contribute to reducing waste by using fewer disposable items and actively participating in recycling and reuse.
This way, we can protect the environment and our own health.</p><div class="desc-background trash"></div></div></div><div id="plastic" class="description-container"><div><h3 class="desc-title">plastic</h3><p class="desc-text">The global plastic production was less than 2 million tons in the 1950s, but it reached 320 million tons in 2021.
The amount has increased more than 160 times in 70 years, and about 80 million tons of plastic flow into the ocean every year, threatening the ecosystem and human health.
Recycling plastic can reduce the need for new plastic production, which also saves energy and resources.
Using reusable bags, tumblers instead of disposable cups, and reusing water bottles and beverage containers can significantly reduce plastic usage and help protect the environment.</p></div></div><div id="disposable-cup" class="description-container"><div><h3 class="desc-title">Disposable cup</h3><p class="desc-text">Using disposable cups has a serious impact on the environment.
Cups made of plastic do not decompose naturally and exist on the earth for years, contaminating water and soil.
In addition, the energy and resources required for disposable cup production come at a high cost, accelerating environmental destruction and climate change.
Using reusable cups instead of disposable ones has a positive impact on the environment.
Reusable cup production costs less than the resources and energy required for disposable cup production, so there are also economic benefits.
Join in protecting the environment by using reusable cups.</p></div></div><div id="data-trash" class="description-container"><div><h3 class="desc-title">Data trash</h3><p class="desc-text">Our daily lives are filled with data,
but did you know that data also has a significant impact on the environment?
Running data centers requires a lot of electricity, and producing devices such as servers and smartphones also requires a lot of resources.
Additionally, disposing of devices used for data storage is also a problem.
However, there are many things we can do to help.
For example, we can use screen savers or power-saving modes to reduce unnecessary energy consumption when using smartphones or computers.
We can also reduce storage usage by organizing or deleting unnecessary data.
Separating electronic waste from general waste for proper disposal is also important.
It is important for us to consider the environmental impact of the data we consume and find ways to put our thoughts into action.</p></div></div><div id="fashion-pollution" class="description-container"><div><h3 class="desc-title">Fashion</h3><p class="desc-text">Clothing is one of our essential items in daily life,
but it has a significant impact on the environment during the production and disposal process.
Clothing production requires a large amount of energy, water, and chemicals, which can cause air and water pollution.
In addition, there are also issues during disposal.
Clothing has a low recycling rate, resulting in a large amount of clothing waste that harms the natural environment.
We can enjoy stylish clothes while reducing environmental pollution.
Choose high-quality clothes that you can wear for a long time.
The more you wear clothes, the less you need to produce, which helps protect the natural environment.
Recycle or donate clothes!
Reusing clothes reduces the energy and resources needed to produce new clothes, which helps protect the environment.
Dispose of clothes properly!
Clothes should be treated as recyclable waste, not general waste, and should be handled in accordance with local recycling regulations.
We can do a lot for environmental protection through simple choices and actions.</p></div></div><div id="fossil-fuel" class="description-container"><div><h3 class="desc-title">Fossil fuel</h3><p class="desc-text">Fossil fuels are one of the major culprits of environmental pollution.
Burning fossil fuels generates a large amount of greenhouse gases and harmful substances, causing problems such as global warming, air pollution, and acid rain.
However, there are many things we can do to reduce environmental pollution caused by fossil fuels.
One of them is to save energy and use eco-friendly alternative energy sources.
In addition, using environmentally friendly transportation such as public transportation or bicycles can help reduce air pollution.
We can do a lot for environmental protection with our simple choices and actions.</p></div></div><div class="bottom-boundary"></div><div><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7134579063537339" data-ad-slot="5391522351" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></div></section></main></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"testCase":"zero-waste","localeOrTestCase":"en"},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/[localeOrTestCase]/[testCase]","query":{"localeOrTestCase":"en","testCase":"zero-waste"},"buildId":"CaFzB_j6fH0dMxBdPrepe","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
